What is NumPy?
NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is a fundamental library for numerical and scientific computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. NumPy serves as the foundation for many data science and machine learning libraries, making it an essential tool for data analysis and scientific research in Python.

Key aspects of NumPy in Python:
Efficient data structures: NumPy introduces efficient array structures, which are faster and more memory-efficient than Python lists. This is crucial for handling large data sets.

Multi-dimensional arrays: NumPy allows you to work with multi-dimensional arrays, enabling the representation of matrices and tensors. This is particularly useful in scientific computing.

Element-wise operations: NumPy simplifies element-wise mathematical operations on arrays, making it easy to perform calculations on entire data sets in one go.

Random number generation: It provides a wide range of functions for generating random numbers and random data, which is useful for simulations and statistical analysis.

Integration with other libraries: NumPy seamlessly integrates with other data science libraries like SciPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, enhancing its utility in various domains.

Performance optimization: NumPy functions are implemented in low-level languages like C and Fortran, which significantly boosts their performance. It's a go-to choice when speed is essential.


Operation with NumPy
Here's the list of operation which can be performed using Numpy

Operation	Description	Example
Array Creation	Creating a NumPy array.	arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
Element-Wise Arithmetic	Element-wise addition, subtraction, and so on.	result = arr1 + arr2
Scalar Arithmetic	Scalar addition, subtraction, and so on.	result = arr * 2
Element-Wise Functions	Applying functions to each element.	result = np.sqrt(arr)
Sum and Mean	Calculating the sum and mean of an array.Calculating the sum and mean of an array.	total = np.sum(arr)<br>average = np.mean(arr)
Maximum and Minimum Values	Finding the maximum and minimum values.	max_val = np.max(arr)<br>min_val = np.min(arr)
Reshaping	Changing the shape of an array.	reshaped_arr = arr.reshape(2, 3)
Transposition	Transposing a multi-dimensional array.	transposed_arr = arr.T
Matrix Multiplication	Performing matrix multiplication.	result = np.dot(matrix1, matrix2)
