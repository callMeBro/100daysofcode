COURSERA NOTES


ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD column_name data_type;

A variation of the syntax for adding column is:
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD COLUMN column_name data_type;

By default, all the entries are initially assigned the value NULL. You can then use UPDATE statements to add the necessary column values.


For example, to add a telephone_number column to the author table in the library database, the statement will be written as:

ALTER TABLE author 
ADD telephone_number BIGINT;

Modify column data type
ALTER TABLE table_name
MODIFY column_name data_type;


Sometimes, the data presented may be in a different format than required. In such a case, we need to modify the data_type of the column. For example, using a numeric data type for telephone_number means you cannot include parentheses, plus signs, or dashes as part of the number. For such entries, the appropriate choice of data_type is CHAR.

To modify the data type, the statement will be written as:

ALTER TABLE author
MODIFY telephone_number CHAR(20);...
